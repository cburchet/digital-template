<h2>Raining Cats and Dogs</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Time limited game involving scoring as many points as you can by catching the dogs.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to race against the clock to attempt to score as many points as they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player moves left and right with the arrow keys and can jump with the up key in an attempt to catch as many dogs as they can before they hit the ground.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Creation of cats and dogs which the player can catch to gain or lose points.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game randomly creates dogs and cats at varying heights and falling speeds to be caught.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This is a world where instead of water falling from the sky it rains cats and dogs. Your job as a dog catcher  is to go out
when it rains and stop as many dogs from hitting the ground as you can. The cats are fine they always land on their feet.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
NA
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Competitive dog lovers and cat haters.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
2 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Staying towards the middle to make it easier to reach where the larger number of dogs are falling and to easily avoid the cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I got my assets from this website:
